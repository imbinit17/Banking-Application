Banking Application using Java GUI (Beginner)

Working : -

After logging in ,the user has five options :- 
1. View Profie
2. Fund Transfer
3. View Balance
4. Change Password
5. Log Out

Files in the project :- 
1. Functioning.mp4

5. server.java
6. dataManager.java

This project is not yet supposed to be called final by me as many features can be brought along among one which I dropped (bypassed OTP authentication) .If anyone can help me with the email part ,please do .
